# Prerequisites

Lab 0 and 1 require understanding of Linear Algebra.
If the recipient does not have this understanding, then checkout [Andrew Ng's linear algebra review](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/38jIT/matrices-and-vectors).

Lab 2 requires fundamental understanding of regression, classification, and neural networks.
If the recipient does not have this understanding, then checkout week 1 through 6 in [Andrew Ng's machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

Lab 3 requires understanding of convolutional neural networks.
If the recipient does not have this understanding, then checkout [Stanford's cs231 lecture 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNb2fEVKeEo&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv).
